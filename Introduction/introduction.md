# Introduction to C++ STL

1. STL stands for Standard Template Library
2. It consist of 3 main components:
   1. Container - To store the data in vector, list...etc
      * objects that holds other objects.
   2. Iterator  - Accessing data stored in container class such as vector, array, list...etc 
      * Acts as pointers
   3. Algorithm - Step by step procedure and set of instructions to perform a specific task or solve a problem. 
       * Acts on containers
       * You will manipulate content of the containers

# Types of Containers

1. Vector - Dynamic Array
2. Deque - Double ended queue
3. List - Linear List

## also known as **Sequence Containers**

# Types of Iterators

1. Random Access - store and retrieve values.
2. Bidirectional - store and retrieve values. forward and backward direction.
3. Forward - store and retrieve values. only forward direction.
4. Input - retrieve only. forward moving.
5. Output - store only. forward moving.
