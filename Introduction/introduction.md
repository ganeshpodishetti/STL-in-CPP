   1. Container - To store the data in vector, list...etc
      * objects that holds other objects.
   2. Iterator  - Accessing data stored in container class such as vector, array, list...etc 
      * Acts as pointers
   3. Algorithm - Step by step procedure and set of instructions to perform a specific task or solve a problem. 
       * Acts on containers
       * You will manipulate content of the containers
